# Retro Maze Game AI

This repository contains the code and models for training an AI model to play a retro maze game. The AI model is trained using reinforcement learning techniques to navigate through the maze and reach the goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Introduction

The Retro Maze Game AI project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of autonomously navigating a maze-like environment. The AI model is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm implemented in the Stable Baselines3 library. The trained model demonstrates the ability to learn and improve its performance over time.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning:** The AI model is trained using the PPO algorithm, which is a popular on-policy reinforcement learning method.
- **Maze Environment:** The project includes a custom maze environment designed specifically for this game. The environment provides a challenging and dynamic setting for training the AI model.
- **Training Code:** The repository provides code for training the AI model. It includes the necessary setup, hyperparameters, and training loop to train the model from scratch.
- **Testing Code:** The repository also includes code for testing the trained model. You can evaluate the model's performance on unseen maze scenarios and observe its decision-making capabilities.
- **Model Checkpoints:** We have included model checkpoints at different training steps, allowing you to explore and use models trained at various stages of the training process.
- **Training Logs:** The logs folder contains detailed training logs, documenting the training progress, rewards, and other metrics. These logs provide insights into the model's learning process and performance over time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Retro Maze Game AI project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/your-username/retro-maze-game-ai.git](https://github.com/Nirab123456/Maze_RL_Research.git)`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Train the AI model: `maze.ipynb`
4. Test the trained model: `trst.ipynb`

Please refer to the documentation for more detailed instructions on running the training and testing code.

## Results

The trained AI model demonstrates remarkable performance in navigating through the maze environment. Despite a decrease in performance initially, the model shows significant improvement after reaching the 50,000,000 training step milestone. It develops its own strategies to overcome obstacles and reach the goal efficiently.

We provide the trained models at different training steps, allowing you to explore the model's progression and witness its learning process firsthand. Additionally, the training logs provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, rewards, and training progress.
